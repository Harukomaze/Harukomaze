Hello there! I’m Harukomaze or alternatively, you can call me Pizer

I’m interested in learning new languages a lot

I’m currently learning C# basics

I am also quite new to programming, and so far have only learned intermediate python

Alternatively, I often go to codewars.com to solve coding problem, and it's really fun.

You can find my profile here: https://www.codewars.com/users/Harukomaze
